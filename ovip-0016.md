# Abstract

This Ovip proposes to replace the usage of the obsolete Whisper messaging protocol for the OpenVASP messaging layer with the [Waku](https://github.com/status-im/nim-waku) messaging protocol implemented by Status.

# Specification

The Waku network client API is backwards compatible with the Whisper client API. Thus, changing the messaging Layer is as easy as connecting to a url which is pointing to a Waku client.

# Motivation

Whisper has officially been deprecated and is not maintained any further: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21487.
The Status team has forked the project and is maintaining and developing the network as Waku. We expect higher stability, ongoing development and a technically brigher future by switching messaging protocols.

# Backwards Compatibility

As the Whisper and Waku networks are not connected per default, this is to be considered a backwards incompatible change. In terms of development, implementing this ovip is as easy as changing the Whisper url config entry to a Waku client url.
