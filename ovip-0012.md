# Abstract

This OVIP specifies the initial implementation of the [VASP Registry](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0011.md) interface. It provides a centrally managed lookup for linking VASP Identifiers to real world entities using decentral storage and accessibility.

As specified in [OVIP-0011](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0011.md) the VASP Directory consists of a lookup smart contract, the VASP Registry, providing a reference to VASP Credentials and a data source for fetching the VASP Credentials. Here the lookup value consists of the Keccak256 hash of the VASP Credentials. The data source will be Ethereum event logs which are emitted when inserting new data.

# Roles

Note that all roles are represented as Ethereum addresses. This implies that they can take shape as a standard Ethereum address with private key access, but also as a smart contract which could represent more complex access policies (e.g. multisig).

**Consumer**
End-user of the VASP Directory. Wants to retrieve verifiable Credentials.

**Administrator**
Responsible for managing the content of the VASP Directory.

**Owner**
Responsible for managing the lifecycle of the VASP Directory

# Methods

## Fetching Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
function getCredentialsRef
(
    bytes6 vaspId
)
    external virtual view
    returns (string memory credentialsRef, bytes32 credentialsHash);
```

**Description:**
This method is inherited from the VASP Registry interface. It is a read-only query that can be executed by anyone. It is used to retrieve a reference to the Credentials and verifiable proof of data integrity.

**Behavior:**
Given a VASP Identifier (*vaspID*) it returns a tuple of two strings. The first string returned represents the reference for fetching the Credentials, here the tKeccak256 hash of the credentials. The second parameter is also the Keccak256 hash of the credentials and can be used to verify their content. The reason for redundancy is to comply with the [VASP Registry](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0011.md) interface.
## Insertion of Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
function insertCredentials
(
    bytes6 vaspId,
    string calldata credentials
)
    external
```

**Description:**
This method is used by the administrator to insert new *credentials* and their SHA256 hash value, *credentialsHash* for a specific VASP with identifier *vaspID*. 

**Behavior:**
There can only be one lookup value per VASP Identifier. If there is no existing entry for the VASP Identifier, a new entry will be  created. If this method is called for a VASP Identifier which already exists, the method should fail. Overwriting of values is only possible by revoking them first.
The Keccak256 hash of the credentials is calculated as part of this method and inserted into the Directory. The credentials themselves are not stored explicitly.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
CredentialsInserted(bytes6 indexed vaspId, bytes32 indexed credentialRef, bytes32 indexed credentialsHash, string credentials);
```

## Revocation of Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
function revokeCredentials
(
    bytes6 vaspId
)
    external
```

**Description:**
This method is used by the administrator to revoke the *credentials* for a specific VASP with identifier *vaspID*. 

**Behavior:**
If there is no existing entry for the VASP Identifier, the method should fail. If this method is called for a VASP Identifier which already exists, the entry in the Directory must be removed.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
CredentialsRevoked(bytes6 indexed vaspId, bytes32 indexed credentialRef, bytes32 indexed credentialsHash)
```

## Add Administrator Role

```pseudocode
function grantAdministratorRole
(
    address account
)
    external
```

**Description:**  
Grants administrator role to the specified account

**Access:**  
Can be called only by *owner*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the owner to grant administrator role to the specified account

## Revoke Administrator Role

```pseudocode
function revokeAdministratorRole
(
    address account
)
    external
```

**Description:**  
Revokes administrator role from the specified account

**Access:**  
Can be called only by *owner*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the owner to revoke administrator role from the specified account

## Renounce Administrator Role

```pseudocode
function renounceAdministratorRole()
    external
```

**Description:**  
Renounces administrator role for the caller

**Access:**  
Can be called only by *administrator*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the administrator to renounce his own permissions.

## Transfer Owner Role

```pseudocode
function transferOwnerRole
(
    address newOwnerCandidate
)
    external
```

**Description:**  
Sets the specified address as a contract's owner candidate.

**Access**
Can be called only by the *owner*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the contract owner to prepare the transfer of the contract's ownership to a new owner.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
OwnerRoleTransferStarted(address indexed currentOwner, address indexed newOwnerCandidate);
```

## Cancel Owner Role Transfer

```pseudocode
function cancelOwnerRoleTransfer()
    external
```

**Description:**  
Cancels ownership transfer.

**Access**
Can be called only by the *owner*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the contract owner to cancel the transfer of the contract's ownership to a new owner.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
OwnerRoleTransferCancelled();
```

## Accept Owner Role

```pseudocode
function acceptOwnerRole()
    external
```

**Description:**  
Changes the *owner* of the contract.

**Access**
Can be called only by the *new owner candidate*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the future owner in order to accept transfer of the contract's ownership.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
OwnerRoleTransferCompleted(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
```

## Renounce Owner Role

```pseudocode
function renounceOwnerRole() 
    external
```

**Description:**  
Renounces the owner role

**Access**
Can be called only by the *owner*

**Use Case:**  
Called by the future owner in order to accept transfer of the contract's ownership.

**Use Case:**
Can be called to leave the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call functions callable only by the owner anymore.


## Termination of a Contract

```pseudocode
function terminate
(
    address payable recipient
)
    external
```

**Description:**  
Frees memory allocated by the contract and transfers all potentially accidentally funds send to the contract to *recipient*. 

**Use Case:**  
End the lifecycle of the VASP Index without preserving the existing mapping. Invalidates and obsoletes existing entries.

# Backwards Compatibility

The specification proposed in this OVIP present a previously not specified part of the protocol. Client implementations that do not follow this standard will still be compatible with the network. Thus this OVIP is backwards compatible.
