# Abstract

This OVIP specifies the initial implementation of the [VASP Registry](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0011.md) interface. It provides a centrally managed lookup for linking VASP Identifiers to real world entities using decentral storage and accessibility.

As specified in [OVIP-0011](https://github.com/OpenVASP/ovips/blob/master/ovip-0011.md) the VASP Directory consists of a lookup smart contract, the VASP Registry, providing a reference to VASP Credentials and a data source for fetching the VASP Credentials. Here the lookup value consists of the Ethereum transaction id which inserted the VASP Credentials. The data source will be Ethereum event logs which are emitted when inserting new data.

# Roles

Note that all roles are represented as Ethereum addresses. This implies that they can take shape as a standard Ethereum address with private key access, but also as a smart contract which could represent more complex access policies (e.g. multisig).

**Consumer**
End-user of the VASP Directory. Wants to retrieve verifiable Credentials.

**Administrator**
Responsible for managing the content of the VASP Directory.

**Owner**
Responsible for managing the lifecycle of the VASP Directory

# Data Structures

**The Dictionary**
Uniquely maps a bytes12 (VASP Identifier) to a tuple: (string, byte32) <=> (Credentials reference, Credentials hash).

**State Variables**

```pseudocode
owner: address {internal}
candidateOwner: address {internal}
administrator: address {internal}
```

# Methods

## Fetching Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
**getCredentialRef(bytes12 vaspID) returns (string, bytes32) {public}**
```

**Description:**
This method is inherited from the VASP Registry interface. It is a read-only query that can be executed by anyone. It is used to retrieve a reference to the Credentials and verifiable proof of data integrity.

**Behavior:**
Given a VASP Identifier (*vaspID*) it returns a tuple of two strings. The first string returned represents the reference for fetching the Credentials, here the transaction id with which the Credentials were inserted. The second parameter is the Keccak256 hash of the credentials and can be used to verify their content.

## Insertion of Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
insertCredentials(bytes12 vaspID,string credentials) {Administrator}
```

**Description:**
This method is used by the administrator to insert new *credentials* and their SHA256 hash value, *credentialsHash* for a specific VASP with identifier *vaspID*. 

**Behavior:**
There can only be one lookup value per VASP Identifier. If there is no existing entry for the VASP Identifier, a new entry will be  created. If this method is called for a VASP Identifier which already exists, the method should fail. Overwriting of values is only possible by revoking them first.
The Keccak256 hash of the credentials is calculated as part of this method and inserted into the Directory. The credentials themselves are not stored explicitly.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
CredentialsInserted(bytes12 indexed vaspID, bytes32 indexed credentialsHash, string credentials)
```
On any successful insertion of Credentials the *CredentialsInserted* event must be emitted. It presents the storage of the credentials, and thus represents an integral part of the solution.

## Revocation of Credentials

**Signature:**

```pseudocode
revokeCredentials(bytes12 vaspID) {Administrator}
```

**Description:**
This method is used by the administrator to revoke the *credentials* for a specific VASP with identifier *vaspID*. 

**Behavior:**
If there is no existing entry for the VASP Identifier, the method should fail. If this method is called for a VASP Identifier which already exists, the entry in the Directory must be removed.

**Event log:**

```pseudocode
CredentialsRevoked(bytes12 indexed vaspID, bytes32 indexed credentialsHash)
```
On any successful revocation of Credentials the *CredentialsRevoked* event must be emitted. It logs the history of revocations. The *credentialsHash* is an integral component of the log as it serves as a identifying reference to the revoked credentials, which will also be found as part of the logs.

## Change Administrator

```pseudocode
transferAdministrator(address newAdministrator) returns bool {owner}
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `administrator` to the specified `newAdministrator`.

**Conditions:**  
None

**Use Case:**  
Called by the contract owner to change the contract's administrator.

## Transfer Ownership

```pseudocode
transferOwnership(address newOwner) returns bool {owner}
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `candidateOwner` to the specified `newOwner`.

**Conditions:**  
None

**Use Case:**  
Called by the contract owner to prepare the transfer of the contract's ownership to a new owner.

## Accept Ownership

```pseudocode
acceptOwnership() returns bool {candidateOwner}
```

**Description:**  
Sets the contract's state variable `owner` to `candidateOwner` and returns `true`.  
Returns `false` if condition is not met.

**Conditions:**  
Function is called by the address that is stored in state variable `candidateOwner`.

**Use Case:**  
Called by the future owner in order to accept transfer of the contract's ownership.

## Terminate Contract

```pseudocode
terminateContract() returns bool {owner}
```

**Description:**  
Ends the lifecycle of the VASP Directory.

**Behavior:**  
Function clears (removes) all content of the dictionary. Subsequently the owner and the administrator are set to 0x0.

**Use Case:**  
Called by the owner if the contract is no longer maintained. It ensures the there will be no misuse of the contract's data going forward. 

# Backwards Compatibility

The specification proposed in this OVIP present a previously not specified part of the protocol. Client implementations that do not follow this standard will still be compatible with the network. Thus this OVIP is backwards compatible.
