# Abstract

This OVIP specifies the transport layer implementation for the OpenVASP protocol using Ethereum Whisper. It is a revision of the initial specification proposed in the OpenVASP White Paper.

# Specification

## 1. Ethereum Whisper

The Whisper messaging system has been developed as part of the Ethereum technology stack but can be used separately from the blockchain. It was designed to provide resilience and strong privacy in a peer-to-peer environment and targets message delivery below five seconds on a global scale.

The online documentation about the Whisper protocol can be found here: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/whisper/whisper-overview.

## 2. Definitions

**Node**</br>
System operating a Whisper node providing the transport layer service for the OpenVASP protocol.

**Connection**</br>
Two *Nodes* sharing a common identifier representing a connection and an associated shared key, which can be used to exchange *Envelopes* containing an encrypted *Message*. Both *Nodes* have sent each other a Whisper topic to be used to send *Envelopes* related to this connection.

**Active Node**</br>
*Node* inviting another node to establish a *Connection*.

**Passive Node**</br>
*Node* responding to an invitation, either accepting or denying the *Connection*.

**Initiator**</br>
VASP operating the *Active Node*.

**Responder**</br>
VASP operating the *Passive Node*.

**Sender**</br>
VASP sending an *Envelope*.

**Receiver**</br>
VASP receiving an *Envelope*.

**Envelope**</br>
Envelopes are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. They contain the encrypted *Message* and metadata for decryption.

**Message**</br>
Message part of an *Envelope*, containing the message *Payload*, metadata and optional signature. Not to be confused with OpenVASP Messages, which are defined on the higher Session Layer.

**Payload**</br>
Actual message payload within a *Message* transmitted by an *Envelope*.

## 3. Envelope Level

Whisper *Envelopes* are the packets sent and received by Whisper nodes. Once decoded, they have the following format:

```pseudocode
[ Version, Expiry, TTL, Topic, AESNonce, Data, EnvNonce ]
```

The table below provides an overview about each of these elements and their usage as part of OpenVASP.

| Element    | Description                              | OpenVASP Usage                   | See   |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---- |
| `Version`  | Currently one byte containing zero       | As per Whisper default           |       |
| `Expiry`   | UNIX time in seconds                     | As per Whisper default           |       |
| `TTL`      | Time-to-live in seconds                  | As indicated in this document    | 5./6. |
| `Topic`    | Probabilistic hint about encryption key  | As indicated in this document    | 5./6. |
| `AESNonce` | Salt (96-bit) for symmetric encryption   | Randomly set for each *Envelope* |       |
| `Data`     | Contains encrypted Whisper *Message*     | Defined *Message* structure      | 4.    |
| `EnvNonce` | Nonce used for Proof-of-Work calculation | As per Whisper default           |       |

## 4. Message Level

Upon receipt of an *Envelope*, if the node detects a known topic, it tries to decrypt the `Data` element with the corresponding symmetric or asymmetric key. If decryption is successful, the *Message* is revealed with the following structure:

| Element     | Description                           | OpenVASP Usage               | See  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :--- |
| `flags`     | Flags to specifiy *Payload* structure | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `padding`   | Random padding data, optional         | As per Whisper default       |      |
| `payload`   | Message *Payload*                     | OpenVASP *Payload* structure | 4.1. |
| `signature` | Signature, optional                   | Not used                     |      |

### 4.1. OpenVASP Payload

The table below shows the structure of the OpenVASP *Payload*. The last four elements are present depending on the value of the `instruction` element.

| Element       | Length         | Present | Description                                       | See   |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :---- |
| `version`     | 1 byte         | Always  | OpenVASP *Payload* version, currently set to zero |       |
| `instruction` | 3 bits         | Always  | Instructions to control a *Connection*            | 4.1.1 |

| `envelopeID`  | 16 bytes       | Always  | Randomly set *Envelope* identifier                |       |
| `envelopeACK` | 16 bytes       |         | Reference to an *Envelope* identifier             |       |
| `returnTopic` | 4 bytes        |         | Return topic                                      |       |
| `ecdhPK`      | 32 bytes       |         | ECDH public key                                   |       |
| `ovMessage`   | arbitrary size |         | Session Message (JSON)                            |       |

#### 4.1.1. Instructions

The `instruction` element can have the following values:

| Value | Sent by                    | Description                                        |
| :---- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `000` | *Active* or *Passive Node* | Acknowledge *Envelope* receipt (ACK)               |
| `001` | *Active Node*              | Inviting for a *Connection* (INVITE)               |
| `010` | *Passive Node*             | Accepting a *Connection* invitation (ACCEPT)       |

| `100` | *Active* or *Passive Node* | Sending an *Envelope* over a *Connection* (UPDATE) |
| `101` | *Active* or *Passive Node* | Closing a *Connection* (CLOSE)                     |

#### 4.1.2. Acknowledgment

*Nodes* must acknowledge the receipt of certain *Envelopes* by returning an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK. The table below shows which Envelopes must be acknowledged.

| To be acknowledged | Envelopes with `instruction` value (see 4.1.1) |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| YES                | INVITE, ACCEPT, UPDATE, CLOSE                  |
| NO                 | DENY, ACK                                      |

## 5. Connections

This sections explains how the *Node* is internally handling *Connections* without being normative about the actual implementation.

### 5.1. Connection Set

Each *Node* maintains the set of *Connections* established with other *Nodes*. *Connections* have no state, they are either present (and therefore in the set) or not.

### 5.2. Permanent vs. Transient Connections

Each VASP using the OpenVASP protocol must be contactable via its VASP Identifier. The VASP's *Node* must therefore always have this *Connection* in its set, which is called the **Permanent** *Connection*.

A *Node* serving several VASPs (or a VASP group operating with different legal entities) might have several Permanent *Connections* in its set.

All other Connections are called **Transient** *Connections*, as they are only in the set as long as they are open.

### 5.3. Connection Properties

*Connections* have the following properties:

| Element         | Description                                                  | Value in case of a Transient Connection                    | Value in case of a Permanent Connection    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `isPermanent`   | Flag indicating whether this *Connection* is a Permanent *Connection* (see 5.2) | `False`                                                    | `True`                                     |
| `connection`    | *Connection* identifier                                      | *Connection* identifier                                    | VASP Identifier                            |
| `inboundTopic`  | Topic used to identify incoming *Envelopes* related to this *Connection* | Randomly set Topic                                         | VASP Identifier                            |
| `outboundTopic` | Topic used to label outgoing *Envelopes* related to this *Connection* | Topic received from connected *Node*                       | n/a                                        |
| `key`           | Key used to encrypt/decrypt *Envelopes* sent/received over this *Connection*. | Shared key to encrypt/decrypt outbound/inbound *Envelopes* | Private key to decrypt inbound *Envelopes* |

### 5.4. Outbound Envelope Queue

The *Node* maintains a queue of *Envelopes* sent in order to keep track whether their receipt has been acknowledged by the receiving *Node*. Only *Envelopes* that must be acknowledged are included in the queue (see 4.1.2).

Queue items have the following properties:

| Element      | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `envelopeID` | *Envelope* identifier                                        |
| `envelope`   | *Envelope*                                                   |
| `expiry`     | Time when the waiting period for the acknowledgement of `envelope` ends and it is resent |
| `resends`    | Number of times `envelope` had to be resent                  |
| `connection` | Identifier of the associated *Connection*                    |
| `isCLOSE`    | Flag whether the Envelope is of type CLOSE (see 4.1.1)       |

#### 5.4.1. Periodical Check

The *Node* checks regularly for each item in the Outbound Envelope Queue whether its `expiry` time has been reached.

If this is the case, the respective *Envelope* is resent, the `expiry` time is reset and the value for `resents` is increased by one.

*Nodes* should resend *Envelopes* not being acknowledged with an increasingly larger TTL values (e.g. doubling the TTL with each resend).

#### 5.4.2. Connection Interruption

*Nodes* must define a maximal number of resends for *Envelopes* not getting acknowledged.

If this limit is reached for an item in the Outbound Envelope Queue, the respective *Connection* is considered interrupted.

In such a case, the *Node* must:

1. Delete the respective *Connection* item from the *Connection* set.
2. Delete the respective item from the Outbound Envelope Queue.
3. Notify the session layer's *Exception Handling* (see OVIP-7, 3.1) about the interruption.

### 5.5. Validating & Decrypting Inbound Envelopes

Inbound *Envelopes* must be validated as per following steps.

1. Check whether `Topic` (see 3) is present as an `inboundTopic` in the *Connection* set (see 5.3).
2. Check whether `Data` (see 3) can be decrypted with the associated `key` in the Connection set (see 5.3).
3. Check whether the `payload` element of the decrypted message (see 4) conforms to the OpenVASP *Payload* (see 4.1).

If one of the above mentioned checks fail, the Envelope is ignored and deleted.

### 5.6. Acknowledging Inbound Envelopes

*Nodes* must acknowledge certain *Envelopes* (see 4.1.2) by returning an OpenVASP *Envelope* of type ACK.

If required, the *Envelope* is acknowledged as per following steps.

1. Read `connection` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged.

2. Create the *Payload* out of the elements defined in 4.1 and the specified values in the table below.</br>

   | Element       | Value                                                        |
   | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `instruction` | `000`                                                        |
   | `connection`  | `connection` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged |
   | `envelopeACK` | `envelopeID` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* to be acknowledged |

3. Create *Envelope* out of the elements defined in sections 4. and 3. and the specified values in the table below</br>

   | Element | Value / Specification                                        |
   | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `Topic` | `outboundTopic` value looked up in the *Connection* set based on matching `connection` values. |
   | `Data`  | *Message* inclusing *Payload* created in step 2, symmetrically encrypted (AES GCM algorithm as per Whisper standard) with `key` value looked up in the *Connection* set based on matching `connection` values. |
   
4. Send Envelope created in step 3.

### 5.7. Processing Acknowledgements for Sent Envelopes

Received OpenVASP *Envelopes* of type ACK are processed as per following steps.

1. Read `envelopeACK` value from the *Payload* of the *Envelope* received.
2. Lookup item in the Outbound Envelope Queue (see 5.4) based on matching `envelopeID`/`envelopeACK` values
3. If a match can be found with the isCLOSE flag set to `False`, then delete the item from the queue.
4. If a match can be found with the isCLOSE flag set to `True`, then:
* delete respective item in the *Connection* set (see 5.3) based on matching `connection`/`connectionID` values, and
* delete the item from the queue.

## 6. Implementing the Session Layer

An OpenVASP Session knows four state changing operations:

- Initiating a Session,
- Responding to a Session Initiation,
- Ending a Session, and
- Aborting a Session.

In addition, the session layer defines *Application Messages* that are exchanged during an open session.

The reader is recommended to consult OVIP-7 to understand the session model in full detail. This section describes how a conformant *Node* must implement the four above listed state changing operations as well as the exchange of *Application Messages*.

### 6.1. Initiating a Session

| `sessionMessage` | Session Request Message            | OVIP-7, section 4.1 |

##### 6.1.1.2. Processing steps

1. Retrieve public `transportKey` available from the `receiver`'s VASP Contract.

3. Generate random `connectionIdentifier`.

4. Generate random `topicA` the *Node* will listen for to identify incoming *Envelopes* sent over this *Connection*.

5. Generate ECDH private key (`ecdhPrivate`) and ECDH public key (`ecdhPublic`) based on the known `transportKey` using the X25519 key-exchange protocol.

# Motivation

**Transport layer reliability** -- The original specification as per White Paper was amended by introducing acknowledgements in response to community feedback.

**Alignment with new layer model** -- A better separation between the different layers of OpenVASP was introduced by OVIP-9. This OVIP realigns the specification for using Whisper as transport layer with the new layer model.

# Rationale

**Separate encryption on transport layer** -- Separating encryption on transport and session layers will allow for a better security architecture as the internet-facing Whisper could be decoupled from the server handling the sessions. Further, it allows the usage of a Whisper node by different session handlers without giving access to session layers details, particularly originator/beneficiary data.

# Backwards Compatibility

The specification proposed in this OVIP is not backwards compatible.
