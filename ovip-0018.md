# Abstract

The message flow is designed to solve the following problems:

1. enables to decline transactions _a priori_ by using a transfer
   inquiry. This reduces the workload significantly for the
   compliance team.

2. enables to negotiate a payment address _after_ the KYC checks
   have been completed. This eliminates _most_ unwanted payments.

3. enables to share the transaction id _after_ the blockchain
   payment has been executed by using the transfer confirmation.
   This eliminates the need for signed but unbroadcasted transactions
   that require low-level tinkering and are risky because they
   can be executed by simply broadcasting them. The transaction
   id is useful for the beneficiary to check if he has received
   the payment and trigger a human interaction in case it wasn't
   received.

4. enables to link the message flow by using HTTP callbacks.

## Background

OVIP-0018 incorporates the messages defined in OVIP-0014 in the
HTTPS model. Using HTTPS as a transport layer obsoletes OVIP-0007,
OVIP-0009, OVIP-0010 and OVIP-0016. The HTTP callback workflow
completely obsoletes OVIP-0007.

# Specification

## Transfer Inquiry

The originator VASP sends the following POST request to
https://beneficiary.com/transfers/inquiry

```txt
{
    "IVMS101": [see OVIP-0017],
    "asset": {
        "slip0044": [asset identifier as per SLIP-0044],
    },
    "amount": [amount in lowest denomination of asset],
    "callback": "https://originator.com/inquiryResolution?q=4585839457"
}
```

SLIP-0044 is available [here](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md).
The JSON is structured such that it can be easily extended to
support other asset identifier standards in the future.
